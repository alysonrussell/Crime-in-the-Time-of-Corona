### Finding Correlations between Unemployment Data and Violent Crime

## Linear Regression of weekly local crime data

Using local crime data, a linear regression model was applied to observe the direction of certain crime types from the start of the year
to current based on a weekly count of incident occurences. Also, we are looking for any spikes in certain crime types that coincide with the
implementation of orders pertaining to state and county orders. In this model, crime data was obtained from the local database and split
into datasets broken down by the number of crimes per week for all crime, domestic violence, robbery, felonies and misdemeanors. Linear
regression was applied to each dataset individually and the findings were siginificant increases in domestic violence and misdemeanor
crimes, and moderate to small increases in all other categories. 

## Logistic Regression of FBI Crime data and State Unemployment Data

* Initially a K-means clustering machine learning model was chosen and applied, however 

Using unemployment data gathered from the year 1980-2018 for each individual state and violent crime data reported to the FBI for each
individual state, a logistic regression was run to determine if, based on population and crime rate, could a determination of unemployment 
be made. The unemployment rate was broken into 2 categories - Normal for 0 - 5.4, High for 5.5 and up. This range was chosen because the 
rom nearly 40 years of collected data, the mean yearly unemployment rates was 5.5. A logistic regression model was applied to three
different datasets, one for aggravated assault, which is all violent crime minus homicide, robbery and rape, a second model was applied to
robbery and a third to all combined violent crime. Based on population and the total number of crimes, all three models had an accuracy
score of 70% to 71.7%. Aggravated assault had the best performance, with precision, recal and f1-scores averaging 70% for both classes.
