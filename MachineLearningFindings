# Finding Correlations between Unemployment Data and Violent Crime

Using unemployment data gathered from the year 1980-2018 for each individual state and violent crime data reported to the FBI for each
individual state, a logistic regression was run to determine if, based on population and crime rate, could a determination of unemployment 
be made. The unemployment rate was broken into 3 categories - Low for 0 - 3, Normal for 3 - 4.5 and High for 4.5 and up. a logistic 
regression model was applied to two different datasets, one for aggravated assault, which is all violent crime minus homicide, robbery and
rape, and a second model applied to combined violent crime. Based on population and the total number of crimes, aggravated assault resulted 
in a 71% accuracy score and violent crimes resulted in a 72% accuracy score. Both performed well in predicting high unemployment, moderate
in predicting low and both scored very low in using crime to predict "normal" unemployement rates. This would suggest that there is some 
correlation between high unemployment rates and violent crime.
