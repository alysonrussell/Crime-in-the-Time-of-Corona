## Machine Learning Model

For this assignment we have chosen to use linear regression as our model. 
Using linear regression we will explore whether we have experienced an increase in domestic violence since the establishment of shelter-in-place orders in California, and if so the rate at which it has increased. To do this, we will be using the number of reported offenses for domestic violence over the course of time.
With this linear regression model we also hope to predict the continued impact the current situation has on domestic violence should shelter-in-place orders continue for a uncertain amount of time. 
Based on the data available for victim demographics, we may also apply the use of k-clustering to draw additional conclusions regarding the impact of the coronavirus on crime. 

## Database Integration
Team members are expected to present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database
